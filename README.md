# Landing Page Project By Omar Sanjaq

## Description

The Landing Page Project is an interactive web page that initially starts as a static HTML and CSS-based design. The goal is to make the page interactive by enhancing it with JavaScript. This includes dynamic navigation, smooth scrolling, and the active section highlighting when a user scrolls the page or clicks on the navigation links.

The project aims to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and other JavaScript functionalities to improve the user experience and make the website more engaging.
